# This is a personal project with WebDriverIO

My Test Website is: https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com

There are 5 test files in my project.

They are the following:

**test.reg.js:** I automate the registration process here by grabbing the registration form elements and set values in the elements.

**test.login.js:** I automate the login process here by grabbing the login form elements and set values in the elements.

**test.surfing.js:** I visited my website page, grabbed some elements on the home page, and did some actions (scrolling window, tab change) on the grabbed elements here.

**test.product_purchase.js:** I completed the product purchase journey here by grabbing elements from the page, grabbing a product, adding to the cart product, and purchasing the project by filling up the shipping info form.

**test.login_purchase.js:** I automated the login process and completed the product purchase journey here.
